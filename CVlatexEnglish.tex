  \section{Work experience - continued}

  \cventry{Panda ABC}{ESL teacher}{My primary responsibilities were to teach with a large dose of enthusiasm, as opposed to a traditional, strict, test-based teaching approach. I organized classes, prepared lessons for the students and wrote feedback reports after each and every class. Classes were held online, through a proprietary software owned by the company. Class sizes ranged from 1-6 and the ages from 1-16}{}{}{}

  \cventry{Bibo Global Opportunity}{ESL teacher}{I was more of an online friend, rather than a teacher in BGO. I taught (mostly) conversational English to a large number of people from all around the world (primarily Japan). The job was great, because it gave me the opportunity to gain insight on life outside of Bosnia}{}{}{}

My responsibilities were:\newline
1. Assisting my mentor and my team leader in various tasks;\newline
